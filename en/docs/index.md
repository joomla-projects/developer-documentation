# Welcome to the Joomla developers documentation

This website provides developer documentation for [the Joomla CMS](https://www.joomla.org). It is a collaborative effort and is constantly updated for accuracy.

You, too, can contribute to this documentation for the benefit of us all. It can be just fixing a small typo, or maybe document a complete Joomla API. 

Visit the [How to contribute](./contribute/index.md) page for learn how to do that. All it takes is a Github account! 

!!! danger "This developer documentation is meant for people wanting to develop **extensions for Joomla**. It is intended for programmers and users who want to learn Joomla custom extensions development."

!!! tip "To learn how to use or manage Joomla websites, please visit the [Joomla documentation website](https://docs.joomla.org)"
