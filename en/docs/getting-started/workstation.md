## Using Git

The CMS project uses the Git version control system and the CMS repository is stored on Github here: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms. Bugs are fixed in the master branch of this repository, and normally there are bug fixes and changes in the master branch that are more recent than the latest released Joomla version. For this reason, when we test and code bug fixes, we normally use the latest code from the master branch on Github, not the latest released version. Therefore, Bug Squad testers and coders need to understand how to use Git and the Github repository.

For testing and tracking changes, please refer to Git for Testers and Trackers.
For creating your first code change (called a Pull Request) please see Working with git and github/My first pull request
For working with git, please see Git for Coders.
